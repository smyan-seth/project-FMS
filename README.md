**Flight Management System**

# About

The Flight Management System is a Python-based program to manage the core functionalities of airline ticket reservations. This program allows the user to search for **available flights**, **reserve seats**, and **cancel bookings**. It stores passenger details and booking information in a CSV file, providing a simple yet effective solution for flight reservations. Each reservation generates a unique ticket number, and the system ensures that no overbooking occurs by keeping track of available seats.



The key features include:

**Seat Reservation:** Passengers can book seats by providing personal details, and the system generates a ticket with a unique ticket number.

**Flight Availability:** Users can browse a list of available flights with flight numbers, destinations, and costs.

**Cancellation:** The system allows passengers to cancel their reservations, freeing up the seat for other travelers.

**Data storage:** Passenger and booking details are stored in a CSV file to make sure the user data is saved 




This project demonstrates core programming concepts like **object-oriented design**, **file handling**, and **basic error management**, making it a useful and practical tool for managing flight reservations on a small scale.
